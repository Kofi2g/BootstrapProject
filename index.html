                            chart. The song became the lead single for his debut studio album Until Death Call My
                            Name (2018) which peaked at number 7 on the US Billboard 200.

                            In October 2019, Gaulden released the single "Bandit" (with Juice Wrld), which became his
                            first top-ten single. A week later, he released AI YoungBoy 2 (2019), which debuted at
                            number one on the Billboard 200.In April 2020, he released 38 Baby 2, becoming his
                            second chart-topping project on the Billboard 200. Later that year, Gaulden released his
                            second studio album Top (2020), which followed suit as his third chart-topping project in
                            less than a year.[6] In September 2021, Sincerely, Kentrell (2021) was released from prison,
                            topping the charts again, making him the third artist besides 2Pac and Lil Wayne to have a
                            chart-topping album while incarcerated.</p>
